Hello, you've reached the single wget command version of the a2server install
script.  This script is being phased out for a number of reasons.  The most
important is that it is not repeatable.  This script will download things
behind the scenes, run them without much verification, and then delete what it
ran, no matter if the installation finished successfully or not.  The next
time you run the same command, you may get a different (hopefully better)
version.

Right now, a2server ${newVersion} is available.

If you are seeing this text, iKarith (Joseph Carter) hasn't bothered to write
publicly-facing end-user documentation for downloading and installing a2server
a more preferred way.  He's filed an issue about this, please do follow the
instructions there:
	https://github.com/RasppleII/a2server/issues/60

For now, this script does what the old installer used to.
