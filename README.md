# A2SERVER
AppleTalk server for Apple // computers developed by Ivan Drucker

Documentation here is sparse for the moment; see [Ivan's site]() for
information about A2SERVER and how it all works.  There's a lot there and it's
kind of evolved organically over the years just as the scripts themselves
have, so it's going to be awhile before that information can be backfilled and
perhaps organized into something you might call a user manual.

Such a manual should not be considered a replacement for Ivan's organic online
documentation--those contents themselves represent Apple // history, if a
relatively modern piece of it.  As such they should be preserved as they are.

## Developer note

This section used to describe how to run these scripts directly.  That's
changing.  Watch this space.
