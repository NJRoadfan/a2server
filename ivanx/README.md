# Ivan Drucker's A2SERVER documentation

A2SERVER was not so much planned as it was evolved.  It began as a project to
boot an Apple //e card in a Macintosh over AppleTalk using a small embedded
Linux-based computer and evolved over time into what it is today.

So too has its documentation.  And while one of the goals of this project is
to produce a full manual for A2SERVER, the pages on Ivan's website effectively
are a manual if you dig through them a bit.

More than that, Ivan's pages are a piece of recent Apple // history.  Future
endeavors may improve upon what is contained within those pages, but it will
not and indeed cannot replace them.

Thus the content of those pages as of mid-October 2015 (version 1.2.4) is
reproduced here in Markdown format in order to be most widely readable.  Where
no direct non-HTML equivalent for HTML source code exists, this reproduction
will prefer readability to source accuracy, such as replacing formatting based
upon non-breaking spaces with an unordered list.
